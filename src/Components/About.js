        I'm Rebecca Cherry, the creator of this innovative online journal application. With JotIt Down, I wanted to provide a convenient and accessible way for everyone to keep a daily journal, no matter where they are or what they're up to.
        Living in the vibrant city of NYC, I wear multiple hats as a musician, software engineer, mom, and avid explorer. I have a deep love for learning and a passion for various interests like cooking, fitness, and immersing myself in the realms of arts, science, and wellness.
